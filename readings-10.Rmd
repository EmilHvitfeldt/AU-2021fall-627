Please finish reading chapter 6 of "An Introduction to Statistical Learning". The chapter covers Shrinkage methods including ridge and lasso regression.

This will be a good time to finally talk about hyper parameter tuning. We will use the [tune](https://tune.tidymodels.org/) package and [dials](https://dials/tidymodels.org/) package. A great place to start learning about these packages is [this post](https://tune.tidymodels.org/articles/getting_started.html).

The tidymodels labs chapter can be found [here](https://emilhvitfeldt.github.io/ISLR-tidymodels-labs/linear-model-selection-and-regularization.html).
