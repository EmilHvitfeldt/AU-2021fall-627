We will be talking about Support Vector Machines. Please read chapter 9 in "An Introduction to Statistical Learning".

The tidymodels lab sections can be found [here](https://emilhvitfeldt.github.io/ISLR-tidymodels-labs/support-vector-machines.html).

There will not be any labs this week due to Thanksgiving. The corresponding lab will be done next Monday.
