# Dimensionality Reduction

.pull-left[

We looked at

- Principle Component Analysis
]

.pull-right[

Other methods to consider

- t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
- Autoencoder
- UMAP
- NNMF

# Dimensionality Reduction

.pull-left[

We looked at

- Principle Component Analysis
- **Lasso**
]

.pull-right[
Not just useful in linear models

# Clustering

.pull-left[
We looked at

- K-means

# Regularisation Methods

- Ridge
- Lasso

Serves different tasks. Can be combined in some cases

# Supervised Learning

Many of the methods we looked at in this class can be used for both regression and classification

We mainly work with 2 types of trade-offs

- Flexibility / Interpretability
- Bias / Variance

# Supervised Learning

The models we saw in this class lays the foundation for most models which doesn't go under the neural network umbrella

- xgboost
- lightgbm
- catboost
- stacking

---

# Other considerations

- Implementation and run time
- What metrics are important
- Your problem statement
