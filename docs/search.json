Justify your answer.\nThe sample size \\(n\\) is extremely large, and the number of predictors \\(p\\) is small.\nThe number of predictors \\(p\\) is extremely large, and the number of observations \\(n\\) is small.\nThe relationship between the predictors and response is highly non-linear.\nThe variance of the error terms, is extremely high.\nExercise 2 (5 points)\nDescribe the difference between a parametric and non-parametric statistical learning approach. What are the advantages of a parametric approach to regression or classification (as opposed to a noon-parametric approach)? What are its disadvantages?\nExercise 3 (5 points)\nCarefully explain the the difference between the KNN classifier and KNN regression methods. Name a downside when using this model on very large data.\nExercise 4 (5 points)\nSuppose we have a data set with five predictors, \\(X1 =\\) GPA, \\(X2 =\\) extracurricular activities (EA), \\(X3 =\\) Gender (1 for Female and 0 for Male), \\(X4 =\\) Interaction between GPA and EA, and \\(X5 =\\) Interaction between GPA and Gender. The response is starting salary after graduation (in thousands of dollars). Suppose we use least squares to fit the model, and get \\(\\beta_0 = 50\\), \\(\\beta_1 = 20\\), \\(\\beta_2 = 0.07\\), \\(\\beta_3 = 35\\), \\(\\beta_4 = 0.01\\), \\(\\beta_5 = - 10\\).\nWhich answer is correct, and why?\nFor a fixed value of EA and GPA, males earn more on average than females.\nFor a fixed value of EA and GPA, females earn more on average than males.\nFor a fixed value of EA and GPA, males earn more on average than females provided that the GPA is high enough.\nFor a fixed value of EA and GPA, females earn more on average than males provided that the GPA is high enough.\n\nPredict the salary of a female with EA of 110 and a GPA of 4.0.\nTrue or false: Since the coefficient for the GPA/EA interaction term is very small, there is very little evidence of an interaction effect. Justify your answer.\nExercise 5 (10 points)\nThis question should be answered using the biomass data set.\n\n\nlibrary(tidymodels)\ndata(\"biomass\")\n\n\n\nFit a multiple regression model to predict HHV using carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.\nProvide an interpretation of each coefficient in the model. Be careful, note the values Cruise is able to take.\nWrite out the model in equation form.\nFor which the predictors can you reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\beta_j = 0\\)?\nOn the basis of your response to the previous question, fit a smaller model that only uses the predictors for which there is evidence of association with the outcome.\nHow well do the models in (a) and (e) fit the data? How big was the effect of removing the predictor?\n\n\n\n",

We fit a logistic regression and produce estimated coefficient, \\(\\hat{\\beta}_0=-6\\), \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1=0.05\\), \\(\\hat{\\beta}_2=1\\).\nEstimate the probability that a student who studies for 40 hours and has an undergrad GPA of \\(3.5\\) gets an A in the class.\nHow many hours would that student in part (a) need to study to have a 50% chance of getting an A in the class?\nExercise 2 (5 points)\nSuppose that we take a data set, divide it into equally-sized training and test sets, and then try out two different classification procedures. First, we use logistic regression and get an error rate of 20% on the training data and 30% on the test data. Next, we use 1-nearest neighbors (i.e. \\(K = 1\\)) and get an average error rate (averaged over both test and training data sets) of 18%. Based on these results, which method should we prefer to use for classification of new observations? Why?\nExercise 3 (15 points)\nIn this exercise, we will explore a data set about cars called auto which you can find here.\nThe data set contains 1 factor variable and 6 numeric variables. The factor variable mpg has two levels high and low indicating whether the car has a high or low miles per gallon. We will in this exercise investigate if we are able to use a logistic regression classifier to predict if a car has high or low mpg from the other variables.\nRead in the data and create a test-train rsplit object of auto using initial_split(). Use default arguments for initial_split().\nCreate the training and testing data set with training() and testing() respectively.\nFit a logistic regression model using logistic_reg(). Use all the 6 numeric variables as predictors (a formula shorthand is to write mpg ~ . where . means everything. Remember to fit the model only using the training data set.\nInspect the model with summary() and tidy(). Which of the variables are significant?\nPredict values for the training data set and save them as training_pred.\nUse the following code to calculate the training accuracy\n\n\nbind_cols(\n  training_pred,\n  auto_training\n) %>%\n  accuracy(truth = mpg, estimate = .pred_class)\n\n\n\n(auto_training should be renamed to match your training data set if needed.)\nPredict values for the testing data set and use the above code to calculate the testing accuracy. Compare.\n\n\n\n",

Run it, then ignore it.\nIf the system prompts you to install a package, or gives you a “package not found” error, simply run install.packages(\"packagename\") once to install it.\nThe data set\nToday we will use the ames data set containing 82 fields were recorded for 2,930 properties in Ames IA. Run the chunk below to load the data, and to check out the first few rows of your data set.\n\n\ndata(\"ames\", package = \"modeldata\")\nhead(ames)\n\n\n\nThe first thing we need to do with any data set is check for missing data, and make sure the variables are the right type:\n\n\names %>% summary()\n\n\n\nLooks good for this data, with one exception:\nThe next thing we should do is visualize our variables to get a feel for what is going on in this data. There is a lot of variables in this data set so we will focus on Sale_Price, Bedroom_AbvGr, and Gr_Liv_Area.\nSale_Price Sale price in USD\nBedroom_AbvGr Bedrooms above grade (does NOT include basement bedrooms)\nGr_Liv_AreaAbove grade (ground) living area square feet\nData dictionary can be found here.\n\n\names %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Gr_Liv_Area, y = Sale_Price)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\nWe see that there is some kind of trend between them. Let up filter away the observations with more than 4000 observations.\n\n\names_df <- ames %>%\n  filter(Gr_Liv_Area < 4000)\n\n\n\nplotting again to make sure we are filtering correctly\n\n\names_df %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Gr_Liv_Area, y = Sale_Price)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\nLet us see what we get if we include Bedroom_AbvGr in the chart.\n\n\names_df %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Gr_Liv_Area, y = Sale_Price, color = Bedroom_AbvGr)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\nFitting a model\nLet’s begin with a simple linear model. We will look at how Gr_Liv_Area affects the Sale_Price.\nOur first step is to establish a which model(s) we want to try on the data.\nFor now, this is just a simple linear model.\nTo establish the model, we need to determine which R package it comes from (the “engine”) and whether we are doing regression or classification.\n(These functions come from the tidymodels package that we loaded in the setup chunk.)\n\n\nlin_reg <- linear_reg() %>%\n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>%\n  set_mode(\"regression\")\n\n\n\nNext, we will fit the model to our data:\n\n\nlin_reg_fit <- lin_reg %>%\n  fit(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area, data = ames_df)\n\n\n\nLet’s check out the output of this model fit:\n\n\nlin_reg_fit %>% \n  extract_fit_engine() %>%\n  summary()\n\n\n\nHow do we interpret this?\nThe slope is 116.225. That means that for every square foot of living area the Sale_Price would increase by about 115 USD.\nThe p-value of the model is basically 0. That means this model is very significant, i.e., there is probably a relationship between the variables.\nThe r-squared value is 0.52. This means 52% of the variance in sale prices is explained by the area of the above ground living area.\nResiduals\nNow let’s look the residuals of the model.\nFirst, we can find out what values were predicted by the model:\n\n\names_preds <- lin_reg_fit %>% \n  predict(new_data = ames_df)\names_preds\n\n\n\nThen, we can calculate and visualize the residuals:\n\n\names_resid <- lin_reg_fit %>%\n  augment(new_data = ames) %>%\n  select(Sale_Price, Gr_Liv_Area, .pred, .resid)\n\names_resid %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Gr_Liv_Area, y = .resid)) +\n    geom_point()\n\n\n\nDo the residuals seem to represent “random noise”?\nThat is, was our choice of model reasonable?\nWe can also do sepcific predictions to see what\n\n\npredict(lin_reg_fit, tibble(Gr_Liv_Area = 1500))\n\n\n\nMetrics\nIf we are trying to find the “best” model, we should measure how well this one did.\nWe can compute the SSE and MSE “by hand”:\n\n\nsum(ames_resid$.resid^2)\nmean(ames_resid$.resid^2)\n\n\n\nYOUR TURN\nWhat about the bedrooms? What is the patterns with the number of bedrooms? Can you include Bedroom_AbvGr in the model, and interpret the results?\nCreate a new notebook (you can copy this one if you want), and fit a model using both Gr_Liv_Area and Bedroom_AbvGr as predictors. Report your results.\n\n\n\n",

I will try to respond to all course-related e-mails within 24 hours (really) but also remember that life can be busy and chaotic for everyone (including me!), so if I don’t respond right away, don’t worry!\nPre-requisites\nSTAT 520 “Applied Multivariate Analysis” or STAT 615 “Regression”.\nTextbooks\nMain textbook\nThis book will be required reading and we will aim to cover most of the content.\n“An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R” by G. James, D. Witten, T. Hastie, and R. Tibshirani; Springer, 2021. ISBN 1071614177 The latest corrected printing is available on James’s page at https://statlearning.com/\nThe lab sections of ISLR have been rewritten to use tidymodels and can be found here.\nSupplementary books\nThese books are by no means necessary to buy or read to complete this course but serve as great stepping stones for deeper study. Some week’s readings will refer to these books for extra readings.\n“The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction”, by T. Hastie, R. Tibshirani, and J. Friedman, 2nd Edition; Springer, 2009. ISBN 0387848576. Available on Hastie’s page at https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf [more technical; contains advanced explanations and mathematical proofs].\n“Tidy Modeling with R” by Max Kuhn and Julia Silge. Available online at https://www.tmwr.org/.\nCourse Plan\nIntroduction, motivation, and examples. Understanding large and complex data sets. Statistical learning. First steps in R. [Chap. 1-2].\nReview of regression modeling and analysis; implementation in R. [Chap. 3].\nClassification problems and classification tools. Logistic regression and review of linear discriminant analysis. [Chap. 4]\nResampling methods; bootstrap. [Chap. 5 and lecture notes].\nHigh-dimensional data and shrinkage. Ridge regression. LASSO. Model selection methods and dimension reduction. Principal components. Partial least squares. [Chap. 6]\nNonlinear trends and splines. [Chap. 7; 7.4-7.5]\nRegression trees and decision trees [Chap. 8]\nIntroduction to support vector machines [Chap. 9]\nClustering methods [Chap. 10]\nAdditional topics and applications, if time permits.\nAssignments and grading\nAssignments (30%): During the semester I will assign, collect, and grade assignments. You may receive assistance from other students in the class and me, but your submissions must be composed of your own thoughts, coding, and words. A typical homework will include a few problems to do by hand, to see how things work, and a few realistic problems to do using R. Late submission is accepted at a cost of a 5% deduction for each day, with a maximum deduction of 50%.\nLabs (30%): 30-45 minute labs at the end of each class. Each lab covers the material of the lecture. You will have to submit the solutions of each lab on Blackboard the Sunday after each class.\nmidterm (10%) will much like the assignments but with a larger focus on a real analysis.\nProject (30%) (25% report 5% presentation): Each student will receive or choose a data set with data description, problem formulation, and instructions. Using sound statistical methods, you will do the necessary modeling and data analysis and write a report summarizing your results and answering specific questions of your project. A 10-minute presentation summarizing the report will be given to the class or submitted on Canvas.\n90 – 100 % = A\n87 – 90 % = A-\n83 – 87 % = B+\n80 – 83 % = B\n77 – 80 % = B-\n73 – 77 = C+\n70 – 73 % = C\n60 – 70 % = C-\nPlease schedule a meeting with me if you would like to see or discuss your grade at any point during the semester.\nLearning objectives\nGraduate students (STAT 627)\nStudents will be able to:\nIdentify appropriate statistical learning methods for the given problem involving real data.\nUnderstand the underlying assumptions, verify them, and propose appropriate actions if some assumptions do not hold.\nIdentify other possible problems with messy data, such as multicollinearity, understand their consequences, and propose solutions.\nEvaluate the performance of the chosen regression and classification techniques and compare them.\nApply cross-validation techniques to find the optimal degree of flexibility - the best subset of predictors or the optimal tuning parameters.\nShow, analytically, or empirically, the optimal balance between precision within training data and prediction power.\nIllustrate results with appropriate plots and diagrams.\nUndergraduate students (STAT 427)\nStudents will be able to:\nIdentify appropriate statistical learning methods for the given problem involving real data.\nUnderstand the underlying assumptions, techniques available to verify them, and propose appropriate remedies.\nUse training and testing data to evaluate the performance of the chosen regression and classification techniques and compare them.\nUse available empirical tools to find the optimal balance between precision within training data and prediction power.\nIllustrate results with appropriate plots and diagrams.\nStudents will demonstrate competence in using different statistical learning methods involving large, messy, and multi-dimensional numerical and categorical data. Methods include linear, logistic, and polynomial regression with proper variable selection, linear and quadratic discriminant analysis, K-nearest neighbor classifier, bootstrap, ridge regression, lasso, principal components regression, partial least squares, splines, regression and classification trees, support vector machines, clustering, and related methods. In addition, graduate students (STAT 627) will demonstrate competency in the analytic justification of the chosen methods, tuning of the algorithms, and evaluating their prediction power.\nOnline help\nData science and statistical programming can be difficult. Computers are stupid and little errors in your code can cause hours of headache (even if you’ve been doing this stuff for years!).\nFortunately, there are tons of online resources to help you with this. Two of the most important are StackOverflow (a Q&A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions) and RStudio Community (a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (i.e. you)).\nIf you use Twitter, post R-related questions, and content with #rstats. The community there is exceptionally generous and helpful.\nSearching for help with R on Google can sometimes be tricky because the program name is, um, a single letter. Google is generally smart enough to figure out what you mean when you search for “r scatterplot,” but if it does struggle, try searching for “rstats” instead (e.g. “rstats scatterplot”).\nAdditionally, we have a class chatroom at Slack where anyone in the class can ask questions and anyone can answer. I will monitor Slack regularly and will respond quickly. Ask questions about the readings, assignments, and project. You’ll likely have similar questions as your peers, and you’ll likely be able to answer other people’s questions too.\nSoftware\nWe will be using R and tidymodels in this class. While not required, it is highly recommended that you use an IDE for R, I recommend https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/.\nLearning during a pandemic\nLife absolutely sucks right now. None of us is really okay. We’re all just pretending.\nYou most likely know people who have lost their jobs, have tested positive for COVID-19, have been hospitalized, or perhaps have even died. You all have increased (or possibly decreased) work responsibilities and increased family care responsibilities—you might be caring for extra people (young and/or old!) right now, and you are likely facing uncertain job prospects (or have been laid off!).\nI’m fully committed to making sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class! I will make whatever accommodations I can to help you finish your exercises, do well on your projects, and learn and understand the class material. Under ordinary conditions, I am flexible and lenient with grading and course expectations when students face difficult challenges. Under pandemic conditions, that flexibility and leniency are intensified.\nIf you tell me you’re having trouble, I will not judge you or think less of you. I hope you’ll extend me the same grace.\nYou never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical). You are always welcome to talk to me about things that you’re going through, though. If I can’t help you, I usually know somebody who can.\nIf you need extra help, or if you need more time with something, or if you feel like you’re behind or not understanding everything, do not suffer in silence! Talk to me! I will work with you. I promise.\nLauren’s Promise\nI will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you.\nLauren McCluskey, a 21-year-old honors student-athlete, was murdered on October 22, 2018, by a man she briefly dated on the University of Utah campus. We must all take action to ensure that this never happens again.\nIf you are in immediate danger, call 911 or AU police (202 885-2527).\nIf you are experiencing sexual assault, domestic violence, or stalking, please report it to me and I will connect you to resources or find appropriate contact information for Counseling Center.\nSupport Services\nEmergency preparedness\nIn the event of an emergency, students should refer to the AU Web site http: //www.american.edu/emergency and the AU information line at (202) 885-1100 for general university-wide information. In case of a prolonged closure of the University, I send updates to you by email and will post all announcements on Blackboard.\nMathematics & Statistics Tutoring Lab (Don Myers Building)\nprovides tutoring in Intermediate Mathematics and Statistics. http://www.american.edu/cas/mathstat/tutoring.cfm\nAcademic Support and Access Center\noffers study skills workshops, individual instruction, tutor referrals, Supplemental Instruction, writing support, and technical and practical support and assistance with accommodations for students with physical, medical, or psychological disabilities. Writing support is also available in the Writing Center, Battelle-Tompkins 228.\nCenter for Diversity & Inclusion (X3651, MGC 201)\nis dedicated to enhancing LGBTQ, Multicultural, First Generation, and Women’s experiences on campus and to advance AU’s commitment to respecting & valuing diversity by serving as a resource and liaison to students, staff, and faculty on issues of equity through education, outreach, and advocacy.\nThe Office of Advocacy Services for Interpersonal and Sexual Violence (X7070)\nprovides free and confidential advocacy services for anyone in the campus community who is impacted by sexual violence (sexual assault, dating or domestic violence, and stalking).\nCounseling Center (x3500)\noffers counseling and consultations regarding personal concerns, self-help information, and connections to off-campus mental health resources. Academic Support and Access Center (x3360) offers study skills workshops, individual instruction, tutor referrals, Supplemental Instruction, writing support, and technical and practical support and assistance with accommodations for students with physical, medical, or psychological disabilities.\nReligious Holidays\nStudents may receive accommodation in the course for the observance of a religious and/or cultural holiday. The student should notify the professor as soon as possible should such a need exist. More information about accommodations for religious and/or cultural holidays can be found at www.american.edu/ocl/kay/request-for-religious-accommodation.cfm.\nAcademic Integrity Code\nPlease be sure that you are familiar with AU’s Academic Integrity Code, as I am required to report any cases of academic dishonesty to the dean of CAS.
